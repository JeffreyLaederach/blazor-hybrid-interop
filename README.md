# Overview

This repository is a dashboard for demonstrating different language interoperability capabilities in ASP.NET Core Blazor Hybrid. With Blazor Hybrid, you can take advantage of the benefits of client-side rendering using WebAssembly (WASM) as well as server-side rendering which can host native-compiled code. This allows for extensive flexibility in designating where your web application's components run and also what programming language you can utilize to accomplish different tasks as shown here.

### Languages Used: C#, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, C, Visual Basic .NET, F#
